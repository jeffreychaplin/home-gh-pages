## Information

This is an image of the first 3d model I created where things started to make sense.

Just playing around with a scene... assuming it was done sometime in October.

Some models I made to be used with custom maps in the Id Software game called Quake III Arena.

Models I made for a contest.  I ended up winning 1st place and for a while these were given out to site users for excellence.

A model I made for another contest.  It was to be a character that could fit into the Id Software game Quake III Arena.  I feel this is one of the best and most complete models I've made (it's even playable as a custom character in the game), however, it did not place very well in the contest itself.
