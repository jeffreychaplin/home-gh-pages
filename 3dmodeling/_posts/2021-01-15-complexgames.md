## Information

In 2001, I created various low-poly 3d models for [Complex Games](http://complexgames.com/){:target="_blank"}.  Using sketches provided, I modeled, textured mapped, and rigged the models when required.  All communication was done through email.

Please see below for a sketch example and sampling of the 3d models that I created for Complex Games.
