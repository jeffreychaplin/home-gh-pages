## Information

*Order Up* is a game I originally created for *Ludum Dare 41* on the weekend beginning Friday April 20th 2018.  The theme for Ludum Dare 42 was **"Combine 2 Incompatible Genres"**.  

I really enjoyed this game jam and hope I can at some point rework this game to make it a lot better.
