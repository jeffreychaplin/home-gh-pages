## Information

**Math Animals** is a game I created for my daughters when they were young to help them improve their math skills.  This was one of the first applications I made using Unity.

## About The Game

  How many stars can you collect!  More stars are earned when the correct answer is selected and the number of stars earned drops for each incorrect answer.  Pictures of different animals are revealed as the player progresses through the game.
