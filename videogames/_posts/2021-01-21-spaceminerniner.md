## Information

**Space Miner Niner** is a game I originally created for Ludum Dare 40 during the weekend of Friday December 1st 2017.  The theme for Ludum Dare 40 was *"The more you have, the worse it is"*.  

This is an asteroids type game and beyond the initial Ludum Dare 40 game development time, **Space Miner Niner** has been made into a more complete game through additional research, code development and testing.  Use the link below to see the original Ludum Dare version of the game.

It's a pretty good gig and I hope if all goes well I will become one of the elite... one of the best space miners around.  I will become a...
SPACE MINER NINER!
