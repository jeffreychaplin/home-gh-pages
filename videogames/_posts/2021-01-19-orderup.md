## Information

**Order Up** is a game I created for Ludum Dare 41 during the weekend of Friday April 20th 2018.  The theme for Ludum Dare 41 was *"Combine 2 Incompatible Genres"*.  

This game will be undergoing additional code development and testing in the near future to refine the game beyond the initial Ludum Dare 41 game development time.

## About The Game

**Order Up!** is a combination Restaurant Simulation & Platform game. You are the owner of a popular restaurant where you need to run around collecting food items to complete customer orders (and make a bit of money).
