## Information

**The Circuit** is a game I created for Ludum Dare 39 during the weekend of Friday July 28th 2017.  The theme for Ludum Dare 39 was *"Running out of Power"*.  

This was my first game jam competition.

## About The Game

You are the orange charge. Avoid the red charge. Use the 1, 2 and 3 keys to move to an adjacent wire while over an electrical arc. Collect sparks and… *Don’t run out of power!*
