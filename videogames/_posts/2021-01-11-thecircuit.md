## Information

*The Circuit* is a game I created for *Ludum Dare 39* on the weekend beginning Friday July 28th 2017.  The theme for Ludum Dare 42 was **"Running out of Power"**.  

This was my first game jam competition... and it was sooooo much fun!  Thanks Justin for talking me into doing it!

## Ludum Dare

## Story Of The Game

You are the orange charge. Avoid the red charge. Use the 1, 2 and 3 keys to move to an adjacent wire while over an electrical arc. Collect sparks and… Don’t run out of power!
