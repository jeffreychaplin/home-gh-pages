## Information

**Centifeed 2042** is a game I created for Ludum Dare 42 during the weekend of Friday August 10th 2018.  The theme for Ludum Dare 42 was *"Running out of space"*.  

For this game I was not able to start until late Sunday afternoon... so I did not have much time at all. I ended up scaling way back on what I wanted to do, but I am still pleased with the result.

## Ludum Dare

[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/){:target="_blank"} is an online event where games are made from scratch in a weekend.

## About The Game

**Centifeed 2042** is a snake-like game where you are a hungry centipede looking for good mushrooms to eat so that you can grow up big and strong.
