## Information

**Centifeed 2042** is a game I created for Ludum Dare 42 during the weekend of Friday August 10th 2018.  The theme for Ludum Dare 42 was *"Running out of space"*.  

This game will be undergoing additional code development and testing to refine the game beyond the initial Ludum Dare 42 game development time.  Use the link below to see the original Ludum Dare version of the game.

## About The Game

**Centifeed 2042** is a snake-like game where you are a hungry centipede looking for good mushrooms to eat so that you can grow up big and strong.
