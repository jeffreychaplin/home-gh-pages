## Information

*Centifeed 2042* is a game I originally created for *Ludum Dare 42* on the weekend beginning Friday August 10th 2018.  The theme for Ludum Dare 42 was "Running out of space".  Actually, for this game I was not able to start until late Saturday night... so I scaled back on what I wanted to do and was pleased with the result.

## Ludum Dare

## Story Of The Game

CENTIFEED 2042 is a snake-like game where you are a hungry centipede looking for good mushrooms to eat so that you can grow up big and strong.
