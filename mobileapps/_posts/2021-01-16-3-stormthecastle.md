## Information

I created this Android AR (augmented reality) code-breaking app to learn how to create a multi-player AR game.  It is still currently single player and far from final, but it is playable.  

This game will be undergoing additional code development and testing to refine the game further.

## About The App

Players launch cannon balls (the "codes") at the towers to figure out the code to the castle.  When a tower is hit, it changes to the same color as the cannon ball.  Once all four towers have been changed to a color, clues are given to help the player figure out the code to the castle.  Is the color correct?  Is the color in the right position?

Get all four colors correct and in the right position and... you stormed the castle!
