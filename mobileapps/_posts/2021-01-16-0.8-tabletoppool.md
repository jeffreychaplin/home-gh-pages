## Information

I created this to learn how to create mobile apps.  It is not complete, but it is playable.  

## About The App

Play pool!

Pull back on the cue ball to use the pool stick, set up your shot and release.  Click on the 8, 9 or 10 ball to the left of the table to play either 8 ball, 9 ball or 10 ball.
