## Information

Between 2014-2020, I was a developer for an IDEXX mobile app called [VetConnect Plus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idexx.vcplus&hl=en_US&gl=US).  As of 1/22/2021 this app has had 10K+ downloads on Google Play.  

This position was as an IDEXX contractor while working for Abillis Solutions Corp.

## About The App

*The following was taken from Google Play:*

The go-to diagnostic resource for veterinarians and practice staff. View the status of tests from IDEXX Reference Laboratories, results from all IDEXX diagnostics, patients’ diagnostic histories, and differential diagnoses—anytime, anywhere.
- Instant status updates—Access test results to monitor patient status 24/7.
- Spot trends at a glance—Easily compare patient historical results side-by-side or in graphs for visual trend analyses.
- Differential diagnoses—Interpret results and determine next steps with guidance from IDEXX board-certified specialists using the latest industry protocols, research, and publications.
