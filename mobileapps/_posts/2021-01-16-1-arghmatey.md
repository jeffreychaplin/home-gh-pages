## Information

I created this Android AR (augmented reality) app with the intention of it being used to thank students for contributing to a coin drive.  

## About The App

When viewing the specific flyer, a pirate character will pop up with a voice saying "argh, matey... thank you for your support".  There are two pirate characters that I extracted from the flyer itself (a boy and a girl) and they are randomly chosen to be displayed.
