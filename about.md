# About

Hi!

My name is Jeffrey Chaplin and I've been a professional software developer for 30+ years.
Most recently I have been working as a mobile hybrid app developer and .NET developer.  I've also been developing my own projects in Unity.

I'm currently working on personal projects that include creating mobile apps, video games and tabletop games with my family.
