# About

Hi!

My name is Jeffrey Chaplin and I've been a software developer for over 30+ years.
Most recently I have been working professionally as a mobile hybrid app developer and .NET developer.  I've also been developing my own projects in Unity.

Currently I'm working on mobile apps, video games and tabletop games (with my family).
